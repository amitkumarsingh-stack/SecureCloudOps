# What is Azure Pipelines
Azure Pipelines is a cloud service offered by Microsoft Azure, providing a robust continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) solution. It allows teams to automatically build, test, and deploy code to various platforms and environments.

## Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) involves automating the process of validating and merging code changes into a shared repository frequently. It ensures that as new code is added, it's integrated smoothly without breaking.

## Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery (CD) is a process by which code is built, tested, and deployed to one or more test and production environments. Deploying and testing in multiple environments increases quality.

| Continuous Integration | Continuous Delivery |
| ------ | ------ |
| Increase code coverage | Automatically deploy code to production |
| Build faster by splitting test and build runs | Ensure deployment targets have latest code |
| Automatically ensure you don't ship broken code | Use tested code from CI process |
| Run tests continually |  |
