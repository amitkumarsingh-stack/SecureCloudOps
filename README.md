# About

This repository hosts a collection of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts, templates, and configurations. My goal is to streamline infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and management using code, ensuring consistency, scalability, and efficiency.

## What You'll Find Here
## IaC Scripts and Templates
* Cloud Provisioning: Scripts and templates for deploying infrastructure on various cloud platforms (AWS & Azure).
* Configuration Management: Code for managing configurations, deployments, and updates across environments.

## Kubernetes and AKS
* __Kubernetes Configurations__: YAML files and scripts for Kubernetes deployments, services, and configurations.
* __AKS Deployment__: IaC scripts for deploying and managing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.
## Interesting Documentation
I believe in sharing knowledge! Explore my documentation on:

* __Best Practices__: Tips, tricks, and best practices in IaC, Kubernetes, and cloud-native architectures.
* __Use Cases__: Real-world examples and tutorials demonstrating the power of IaC and Kubernetes.
* __Guides__: Detailed guides and walkthroughs for effectively using IaC tools and Kubernetes features.
## Contribution Guidelines
I welcome contributions! If you have IaC scripts, Kubernetes configurations, or documentation to share, please feel free to submit pull requests. Follow our contribution guidelines outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Get Started
Explore the folders and documentation available to learn, experiment, and contribute to our IaC codebase and Kubernetes configurations.

## Feedback
