# Terraform Azure Repository
Welcome to our Terraform Repository!

About
This repository hosts Terraform code for provisioning and managing resources in Microsoft Azure/AWS. My focus is on using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to automate infrastructure setup, configuration, and management in Azure.

What You'll Find Here
Terraform Configurations
* Azure Resource Provisioning: Terraform scripts to create, manage, and modify various Azure resources.
* Module Definitions: Organized modules for reusable configurations of Azure resources.
# Usage
* Installation: Ensure you have Terraform installed locally. Refer to Terraform Installation Guide if needed.
* Configuration: Set up your Azure credentials and environment variables.
* Deployment: Use Terraform commands (terraform init, terraform plan, terraform apply) to deploy resources.
# Contribution Guidelines
I encourage contributions! If you have enhancements, bug fixes, or additional Terraform configurations for Azure/AWS, feel free to submit pull requests. Refer to CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.

Happy Terraforming in Azure!
